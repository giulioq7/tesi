ASTL beta2.0 
Getting Started

* Clean up directories and build the dependecies file Makefile.d by 
  launching "make clean" (this file must be rebuild each time a new
  .cc file is added into src/ or each time included header files
  change).

* Build all executables binaries in bin/ from .cc files in
  src/ by running "make all". This is the default
  target. This should create a bunch of executable files implementing
  ASTL algorithms as command line filters, see documentation. 
  Type "make RELEASE=1" to build an optimized version of the binaries.

* Run basic tests by running "make check". The process should end with a
  null return value.

* Display possible targets by typing "make help".

* Build the Doxygen documentation by typing "make doc".
