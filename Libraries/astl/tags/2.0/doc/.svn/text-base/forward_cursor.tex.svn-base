\input{cursor}
\verb+char_type letter() const+ & forward cursor & Return the letter
on the pointed transition. The cursor must have been set to point to a
defined transition beforehand by succesfully calling
\verb+first+, \verb+next()+ or \verb+find+. \\
\hline 
\verb+bool first()+ & forward cursor & Make the cursor
point to the first element of the transitions sequence of the source
state. Return \verb+true+ if there is such an element (if any
transition is defined), otherwise the pointed transition is
undefined. \\ \hline 
\verb+bool next()+ & forward cursor & Move the cursor to
the next element of the transitions sequence of source state. Return
\verb+true+ if there is such an element (the cursor is not at the end
of the sequence), otherwise the pointed transition is
undefined. \verb+first+ must have been
successfully called prior to using this method. \\ \hline
\verb+bool find(const Alphabet &a)+ & forward cursor & Make the cursor
point to the transition labelled with \verb+a+. Return \verb+true+ if
such a transition exists, otherwise the pointed transition is
undefined. \\ \hline 
\verb+void forward()+ & forward cursor & Move forward on the currently
pointed transition. The cursor must have been set to point to a
defined transition beforehand by succesfully calling
\verb+first+, \verb+next()+ or \verb+find+. \\
\hline 
\verb+bool aim_final() const+ & forward cursor & Return \verb+true+ if
the aim state is final. The cursor must have been set to point to a
defined transition beforehand by succesfully calling
\verb+first+, \verb+next()+ or \verb+find+. \\
\hline 
\verb+tag_type aim_tag() const+ & forward cursor & Return the object
associated with the aim state. The cursor must have been set to point to a
defined transition beforehand by succesfully calling
\verb+first+, \verb+next()+ or \verb+find+. \\
\hline 
\verb+state_type aim() const+ & forward cursor & Return the handle of
the aim state the cursor is point to. The cursor must have been set to point to a
defined transition beforehand by succesfully calling
\verb+first+, \verb+next()+ or \verb+find+. \\ \hline
